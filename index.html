    <p class="text-muted">The Church of St. Francis Xavier, a Roman Catholic parish in the Jesuit tradition, strives to be a prophetic, welcoming community, and an inclusive witness to the presence of Christ Jesus in our midst. Mindful of our utter reliance on God, and need for God’s grace, we rejoice together in our celebration of the sacraments and proclamation of the Gospel. As a people of hope, we commit ourselves through prayerful and creative discernment to respond to God in our time by: being a respectful community where seekers and their questions are welcomed, where injustice is challenged, where the poor, the alienated and the marginalized find a home, and where people are refreshed, reconciled and renewed.</p>

    <hr>
    <h5 class="text-success">Was Build In 1982</h5>
    <p class="text-muted">HCP Group has a long history of providing honorary professional services St. Xavier’s High School, Loyola Hall, Ahmedabad.  The design brief was Interior Design for the new auditorium space “for varied types of performances” and one that can accommodate a large proportion of the 1,200 pupils.  Our key design aim was to ensure enough flexibility to accommodate a range of school activities and stage performances.  We also needed to make sure that the fixtures and fitting were durable enough to withstand expected wear and tear of a bustling school environment.  The lighting and sound systems were designed to allow for different configurations.  To optimize seating capacity we chose to use bench based seating, which also contributed to the informal ambiance.  Highly durable materials were preferred wherever necessary and rays of vibrant colors added to a sense of warmth and comfort. The outcome was an efficient and smart yet informal environment.  For HCPID it was also an exercise in exploring ways in which the scope for interior design and services can be stretched to accommodate communication or entertainment in built form.  </p>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficent than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a school cateen account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>
